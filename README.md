### Docker container

* #### What is the docker container
A Docker container is a runnable instance of an image. It is a normal operating system process except that this process is isolated and has its own file system, its own networking, and its own isolated process tree separate from the host. Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, and it becomes the unit for distributing and testing your application.

### Docker images
* #### What is the docker image

A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. A Docker image is a read only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. In other words, a docker image is a docker object which is a template for creating containers.


### Docker registry

### Docker volums

    Volumes are persistent data stores implemented by the container engine. Compose offers a neutral way for services to mount volumes, and configuration parameters to allocate them to infrastructure.

### Docker dockerfile
* #### What is the dockerfile
Docker file is a blue print for creating docker images. Each instruction on a dockerfile creates a layer in the image. If you change the dockerfile and rebuild the image, only the changed layers are rebuilt. This makes images lightweight, small and fast. It is always named Dockerfile without an extention.

### Docker network

### Docker client
* #### What is the docker client
Docker client docker is how users interact with docker. docker client sends commands such as docker run to dockerd to be carried out. Docker client can communicate with more than one docker daemon.

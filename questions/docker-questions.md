__________

1. ⭐ Describe base docker components?
    <details> <summary>answer </summary>
      - **Docker Engine** - is installed on the host machine and represents the core of the Docker system. It is a lightweight runtime system and the underlying client-server technology that creates and manages containers.

        Docker Engine consists of three components:

          **Server** — the Docker daemon (dockerd), which is responsible for creating and managing containers.
          **Rest API** — establishes communication between programs and Docker and instructs dockerd what to do.
          **Command Line Interface (CLI)** — used for running Docker commands.

      - **Docker Client**
        Docker users can interact with Docker through a client. When any docker commands runs, the client sends them to dockerd daemon, which carries them out. Docker API is used by Docker commands. Docker client can communicate with more than one daemon.

      - **Docker Registries**
        It is the location where the Docker images are stored. It can be a public docker registry or a private docker registry. Docker Hub is the default place of docker images, its stores’ public registry. You can also create and run your own private registry.

        When you execute docker pull or docker run commands, the required docker image is pulled from the configured registry. When you execute docker push command, the docker image is stored on the configured registry.

      - **Docker Images**
        Docker images are templates used for building containers. Like snapshots for virtual machines, Docker images are immutable, read-only files that consist of the source code, libraries, dependencies, tools, and any other files necessary for running an application. Each image is created from a Dockerfile, which contains specific instructions for building a particular Docker image.


      - **Docker Container.**

      - **Docker Hub**
        Docker Hub is the largest cloud-based repository of container images provided by Docker. It supplies over 100,000 images available for use created by open-source projects, software vendors, and the Docker community.

        The platform allows you to ship your applications anywhere quickly, collaborate with teammates, and automate builds for faster integration to a development pipeline.

        Like GitHub, developers push and pull container images from Docker Hub and decide whether to keep them public or private.

      - **Docker Host**
        Docker host is used to provide an environment to execute and run applications.
        It contains the docker daemon, images, containers, networks, and storage.

      - **Docker client**
        Docker users can interact with Docker through a client. When any docker commands runs, the client sends them to dockerd daemon, which carries them out. Docker API is used by Docker commands. Docker client can communicate with more than one daemon.

      - **Docker Configuration**

        A Dockerfile is a script that consists of a set of instructions on how to build a Docker image. These instructions include specifying the operating system, languages, Docker environment variables, file locations, network ports, and other components needed to run the image. All the commands in the file are grouped and executed automatically.

        An image has multiple layers. Once you run a Docker image to create a container, a new read-write layer is added. This is sometimes referred to as the container layer. The additional layer allows you to make changes to the base image, which you can commit to create a new Docker image for future use.

      - **Docker compose**

        When running and managing multiple containers simultaneously, Docker Compose is a useful tool designed to simplify the process. It strings multiple containers needed to work together and controls them through a single coordinated command.

        Docker Compose is used to launch, execute, communicate, and close containers with a command. This is done using a YAML file which configures the application’s services.


      - **Docker desctop**
      
        Docker Desktop, formerly known as Docker for Windows and Docker for Mac, is an application that allows you to start creating and running containers on Windows and Mac within minutes. It is a simple way of installing and setting up the entire Docker development environment. It includes Docker Engine, Docker Compose, Docker CLI client, Docker Content Trust, Kubernetes, and Credential Helper.

        The tool is used for building and sharing containerized applications and microservices in multiple languages and frameworks, on any cloud platform.

    </details>

1. ⭐⭐⭐ How do you configure Docker to use a different container runtime?
    <details> <summary>answer </summary>
      Docker can be configured to use a different container runtime by following these steps:

      - Install the alternative container runtime on the host system. For example, containerd or CRI-O.
      - Stop the Docker daemon if it is running.
      - Update the Docker daemon's configuration file (/etc/docker/daemon.json) and specify the runtimes section with the desired runtime configuration.
      - Start the Docker daemon. It will now use the specified container runtime.
      - Verify the new container runtime by checking the output of docker info command and inspecting the runtime details.
    </details>

1. ⭐⭐⭐ What is the purpose of Docker namespaces?
    <details> <summary>answer </summary>
      Docker namespaces provide process isolation and resource control for containers. They create an isolated environment for each container, giving the illusion that each container has its own isolated view of the system. Docker uses various namespaces such as PID namespace (processes), network namespace (networking resources), mount namespace (file systems), and more.

      By leveraging namespaces, Docker ensures that containers are isolated from each other and the host system. This prevents processes within containers from interfering with or accessing resources outside their namespace.
    </details>

1. ⭐⭐⭐ How do you limit the resources consumed by a Docker container?
    <details> <summary>answer </summary>
      Docker allows you to limit the resources consumed by a container by using resource constraints. You can limit CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, and network bandwidth. Resource constraints can be set during container creation or updated dynamically using the docker update command. For example:

      **Limiting CPU usage**: Use the `--cpu-period` and `--cpu-quota` options to specify the CPU share and the maximum amount of CPU time a container can use.

      **Limiting memory usage**: Use the `--memory` and `--memory-swap` options to restrict the amount of memory a container can use and prevent it from exceeding the specified limit.

      **Limiting disk I/O and network bandwidth**: Docker provides options like `--device-read-bps`, `--device-write-bps`, `--device-read-iops`, and `--device-write-iops` to control the rate of I/O operations a container can perform.
    </details>

1. ⭐⭐ How do you create a multi-stage build in Docker?
    <details> <summary>answer </summary>
      Multi-stage builds in Docker allow you to create optimized Docker images by leveraging multiple build stages. Each stage can use a different base image and perform specific build steps. To create a multi-stage build, you define multiple FROM instructions in the Dockerfile, each representing a different build stage.
      <br/><br/>
      Intermediate build artifacts can be copied between stages using the `COPY --from instruction`. This technique helps reduce the image size by excluding build tools and dependencies from the final image.
    </details>

1. ⭐⭐ What is the purpose of Docker secrets?
    <details> <summary>answer </summary>
      Docker secrets provide a secure and convenient way to manage sensitive data, such as passwords, API keys, and certificates, within a Docker Swarm cluster. Secrets are encrypted and only made available to services that have explicit access. They help ensure that sensitive information is kept confidential and not exposed in clear text or stored in version control systems.
    </details>

1. ⭐⭐⭐ How do you securely manage secrets in a Dockerized application?
    <details> <summary>answer </summary>
      Docker provides a built-in mechanism called Docker Swarm Secrets to securely manage sensitive information like passwords, API keys, or certificates.

      Using Docker Swarm Secrets:

      Create a secret:

      ```sh 
        echo "secret" | docker secret create my_secret -
      ```

      Deploy the service with the secret:

      ```bash 
        version: '3.8'
        services:
          myapp:
            image: myapp_image:latest
          secrets: 
            - my_secret
        secrets:
          my_secret: 
            external: true
      ```

      In this example, we create a secret called my_secret and use it in the myapp service. The actual secret value is not stored in the Docker Compose file, enhancing security.
